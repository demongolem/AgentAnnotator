# AgentAnnotator
A very robust semi-automated annotation tool for those having to annotate NLP aspects of documents

This project has a dependency on another sentiment rest api that I have developed (to be named and located on git later with link) to perform sentiment analysis on documents as required.

If we are using the sentiment piece as well, we have to make sure that version of CoreNLP used for each one is the same.  At the present moment, AgentAnnotator uses 3.9.1.

I am currently moving the project from another repository to this one with minor edits, so check back soon to see the full code.
