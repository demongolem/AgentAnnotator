Authorities confirmed to KCCI that a witness spotted the cement truck driver fleeing the scene of the crash and later spotted the same man walking at 64th Street and University Avenue.
Police said that, when officers found the man, he fought "ferociously" with four officers. The officers involved are reportedly OK, but police said the man was taken to the hospital to be examined before any charges are filed against him.
The driver of the blue vehicle involved in the crash was hospitalized with serious injuries and the crash caused power outages.
The crash closed portions of MLK Parkway, including the I-235 eastbound exit at MLK /19th Street.
The Des Moines Police Department said traffic control signals are not working due to the power outage and that stop signs are in place to regulate traffic.
Commuters are warned that traffic delays will extend into the evening.
