Cassian Andor is back.
Lucasfilm announced Thursday that a “Rogue One” prequel series is in the works, focusing on the rebel spy’s “formative years of the Rebellion.”
Advertisement “The rousing spy thriller will explore tales filled with espionage and daring missions to restore hope to a galaxy in the grip of a ruthless Empire,” the company said in a statement.
Diego Luna, the 38-year-old Mexican actor who stars in “Narcos,” will reprise his role as the scruffy spy from the 2016 movie with Felicity Jones.
“Going back to the Star Wars universe is very special for me,” Luna said in a statement. “I have so many memories of the great work we did together and the relationships I made throughout the journey. We have a fantastic adventure ahead of us, and this new exciting format will give us the chance to explore this character more deeply.”
The untitled Cassian Andor series is the second “Star Wars” live-action series in the works; “The Mandalorian,” written by Jon Favreau, will “follow the travails of a lone gunfighter in the outer reaches of the galaxy far from the authority of the New Republic” after the fall of the Empire and before the emergence of the First Order.
