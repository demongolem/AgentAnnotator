I first encountered the force that is Mark Dresser at the tender age of 19, right about the time my adventure in jazz began. He was playing in a small art gallery downtown, with a group that featured vocalist Diamanda Galas, cellist Dave Millard, and multi-instrumentalist Jim French. This would have been in 1978. The music was very foreign to me, but Dresser cut an indelible impression—tall, rail-thin, with a beard of Biblical proportions. Advertisements
