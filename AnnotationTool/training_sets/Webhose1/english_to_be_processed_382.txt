Arsenal are now fearing the worst as Emery issued an update after the 0-0 draw with Sporting.
‘He has been taking to hospital. We are going to wait,’ Emery said.

‘His injury was hard for the mentality of the players because they looked at the injury. But when you are playing football in competitive matches it can happen.’
He added: ‘It’s his ankle. He broken something in his ankle.’

The 27-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season and Emery admitted it was a major blow for Welbeck.
He said: ‘He is a very good person, his commitment with us is very big. He helps us with his quality and capacity. This injury is very big for him, for us and for all.’
Arsenal also lost Stephan Lichtsteiner to injury late in the game as the full-back appeared to pull his hamstring.
