PEORIA - The LeapFrog hospital safety grades just came out and one Peoria area hospital fared better than the others.
OSF HealthCare Saint Francis Medical Center received a B, though that was lower score than the A they received in the spring. UnityPoint Health-Methodist received a C, the same grade they received last spring, and UnityPoint Health-Proctor received a D, down from the B they received last spring.
Graham Hospital in Canton and OSF HealthCare St. Joseph Medical Center in Bloomington both received an A, while Advocate BroMenn Hospital in Normal got a B.
Founded in 2000, The Leapfrog Group is a national nonprofit organization working to improve the quality and safety of American healthcare. LeapFrog grades hospitals with an A, B, C, D or F based on 27 measures of patient safety, including patient care management, medication safety, frequency of healthcare-associated infection, and maternity care. The biannual report is calculated by a panel of safety experts. See more details at www.hospitalsafetygrade.org/search. Never miss a story
