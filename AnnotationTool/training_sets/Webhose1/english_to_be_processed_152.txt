BURLINGTON, ON, Nov. 6, 2018 /CNW/ - EcoSynthetix Inc. (TSX: ECO) ("EcoSynthetix"), a renewable chemicals company that produces a portfolio of commercially proven bio-based products, today announced that the SWISS KRONO GROUP has launched a new No-Added Formaldehyde ("NAF") particleboard using EcoSynthetix' DuraBind™ binder. The SWISS KRONO GROUP is one of the world's leading wood-based panel manufacturers.
The launch is SWISS KRONO's latest innovation in the particleboard sector, known as NAF Solution, a new certified panel without adding formaldehyde. The certification meets the highest quality and ecological standards for wood-based materials and is further proof of the attention that SWISS KRONO addresses to sustainability and respect for the environment.
"This is an exciting step in our commercialization strategy for DuraBind. SWISS KRONO is one of the world's largest and most innovative manufacturers of wood-based panels, and an industry leader in its approach toward sustainability," said Jeff MacDonald, Chief Executive Officer of EcoSynthetix. "As the first commercial customer of DuraBind, this new product launch is a natural extension of our relationship with SWISS KRONO. We support their initiative to market an NAF-branded solution for particleboard, and their vision to invest in building a new market with a differentiated product."
"This launch of our new NAF particleboard once again puts emphasis on ecology and eco-sustainable philosophy from which our products and services are born," said Martin Brettenthaler, Chief Executive Officer of the SWISS KRONO GROUP. "Using EcoSynthetix' innovative bio-based binder technology supports our aim to reduce formaldehyde emissions to approximately one quarter of the CARB 2 specifications."
SWISS KRONO has been using DuraBind on one of its production lines since 2016. This launch expands the relationship with EcoSynthetix to include NAF particleboard produced at two additional SWISS KRONO facilities – Zary, Poland and Menznau, Switzerland. SWISS KRONO announced it has produced its first 1,000 cubic metres of particleboard with the next production run scheduled for November.
