Retired Brig. Gen. Donald Bolduc is busy spreading an important message, hoping to erase the stigma around post-traumatic stress disorder. Advertisement
He has help along the way, traveling everywhere with his service dog, Victor.
"Everywhere I go, he's like my shadow," Bolduc said. "And he does it in a way that is completely unobtrusive."
Bolduc suffered a traumatic brain injury in a bomb blast and helicopter crash while deployed. After 32 years of active duty, Bolduc developed PTSD, but kept quiet about his symptoms.
He said most veterans choose to do the same instead of asking for help.
"No way," Bolduc said. "You didn't say anything. (You) kept your mouth shut, you did your job, you moved out and you moved forward."
Bolduc said society members should recognize the bravery it takes to come forward and ask for help.
For him, Victor has been a big part in helping him overcome his symptoms, helping ease the anxiety triggered by crowds, loud noises and driving.
"If we could teach him how to drive that would be even better, but we can't," Bolduc said. "But his presence is a calming factor for me."
