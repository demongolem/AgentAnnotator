She’s caught with her hand in the cookie jar.
A North College Hill mom is accused of stealing over $1,600 worth of Girl Scout cookies from her daughter’s local troop, according to police.
Advertisement Noel Hines, 31, allegedly accepted a large cookie order to sell for the troop in March but when funds were due, the Girls Scouts of Western Ohio claim they never received a payment.
Girl Scout officials and police then tried to contact Hines for six months but were never successful.
“That’s the way the cookie crumbles,” North College Hill police wrote in a Facebook post.
On Tuesday, Hines was arrested for unrelated charges and charged with theft at the North College Hill Mayor’s court, police said.
According to the Girl Scouts of America’s cookie manual , cookies are $4 dollars each — making Hines responsible for around 400 boxes of cookies.
The Girl Scouts of Western Ohio said situations regarding theft in their troop are “infrequent” and “unfortunate.”
“When we have evidence that an adult misuses troop funds, we pursue vigorously and, when appropriate, contact law enforcement to recover as much money for the troop as possible. This is not something we take lightly,” the company said in a statement.
Hines was arraigned and is scheduled to appear in court on Nov. 28.
