Avigilon Expands Cloud Service Platform Into Canada November 8, 2018 No Comments
Avigilon Corporation, a Motorola Solutions company, announced that Avigilon Blue, its cloud platform for video surveillance, is launching in Canada.
The Avigilon Blue platform is a secure end-to-end solution that enables security integrators to deliver analytics-driven video surveillance as a service. It features patented self-learning video analytics technology that is compatible with both legacy Avigilon and third-party ONVIF compliant cameras. Powerful and easy to use, the platform enables integrators to remotely connect to, manage and service more customer sites with fewer resources, the company described. It features alarm notification and subscription dashboards that create a simple and unified view of customer accounts, sites, devices and system health.
“Following a successful launch in the U.S., the Avigilon Blue platform continues to rapidly expand,” said James Henderson, Avigilon’s president and COO. “We are excited to bring this cutting-edge solution to our Canadian integrators, helping them create a new recurring revenue business model while offering additional value to their customers.”
The Avigilon Blue platform in Canada will leverage cloud services that are built, deployed and managed through trusted Microsoft Azure Canadian data centers, offering customers enterprise-grade security that adheres to national policy. Avigilon Blue is expected to be available in Canada in December 2018.
