Breaking Bad is returning to the spotlight again, this time with a sequel film from series creator Vince Gilligan. SlashFilm reports that co-star Aaron Paul will reprise his role as Jesse Pinkman in a story set after the series’ conclusion. As previously reported by The Albuquerque Journal , Gilligan’s new project, currently dubbed Greenbriar , “tracks the escape of a kidnapped man and his quest for freedom.”
Breaking Bad was a record-breaking critical darling by the time its finale aired in 2013. The five-season series has a definitive ending for central antihero Walter White, played by breakout star Bryan Cranston, but that hasn’t prevented additional storytelling within its universe. The prequel series Better Call Saul , starring Bob Odenkirk as a shifty lawyer who had a supporting role on Breaking Bad , has already enjoyed four critically lauded seasons of its own.
Details remain sparse, and there’s no word on whether Greenbriar will include other actors from the original show. Paul’s return is exciting, but please don’t celebrate the new project by throwing pizzas onto anyone’s roof , even if you suspect they are a secret drug lord.
Update, November 7th, 3:06PM : Story has been updated to reflect new information about Aaron Paul and the film’s story.
