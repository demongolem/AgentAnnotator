Free 5x: $200 Visa Gift Cards, no activation at Staples [Starts 11/11] November 8, 2018 by Nick Reyes
Staples will be offering fee-free $200 Visa Gift Cards from Sunday, 11/11 through Saturday, 11/17. That’s a nice deal for an easy 5x for those with a card that earns one of the best category bonuses at office supply stores. The Deal Limit 1 per customer. [YMMV on enforcement] Quick Thoughts
This is a great deal for generating some easy Ultimate Rewards points. Staples Visa Gift Cards come PIN-enabled (typically the last 4 digits of the card) and are pretty easy to liquidate if you live in an area with easy liquidation. Even if not, it’s a great way to get 5x on future purchases if you’ll use the VGC for regular purchases.
You’ll earn 1,000 Ultimate Rewards points with each card assuming you use a card like the Chase Ink Cash card, which earns 5x at office supply stores on the first $25,000 in purchases per year. If you were to move those points to a Chase Sapphire Reserve account and use them to book travel through the Chase portal, they would be worth $15. Transferred to partners, they can be worth much more.
On the most recent round of this promotion, I had no problem buying more than one at all of the stores where I purchased, but YMMV as the promo terms state one per customer. If you are able to buy more than one and/or you have more than one customer playing along in your household, it could be pretty easy to rack up some nice rewards on this one.
