April Ryan has security to protect her from the crazies who might actually view her as an “enemy of the people” … after a series of verbal attacks by President Donald Trump .
April appeared Thursday on “TMZ Live,” and we asked if she was receiving death threats after Trump rudely told her to sit down when she tried asking a question about voter suppression. It’s the latest Trump attack against the American Urban Radio Networks Correspondent.

April didn’t want to talk about specific threats, but made it clear she has a security team in place, which seems to be a reality of life for White House Correspondents who raise the President’s ire .
Ryan made it clear … she doesn’t live in fear and will not back down … but she’s clearly taking precautions.
