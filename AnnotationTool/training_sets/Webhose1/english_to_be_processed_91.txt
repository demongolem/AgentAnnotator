A judge ordered Edmonton police to release Voon’s passport, allowing him to go back to Australia under a list of conditions.
During Voon’s trial in Australia, psychological reports submitted to the court found Voon’s offending was a manifestation of undiagnosed autism and an obsessive compulsive disorder, WA Today reports.
The tribunal found Voon was extremely remorseful and sustained devastating losses, including the sale of his home, assets, practice, reputation, employment and humiliation on social media.
A consultant psychiatrist told the tribunal Voon was undertaking active rehabilitation and was extremely unlikely to reoffend. Get daily local headlines and alerts © 2018 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
