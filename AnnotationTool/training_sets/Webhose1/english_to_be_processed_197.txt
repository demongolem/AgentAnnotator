Passengers were briefly evacuated from the MacArthur Station at the tail end of rush hour Thursday morning after a woman jumped in front of a moving train.
A few of the commuters had tears in their eyes and were hugging on the street as they waited for buses to pick them up.
“She acted like ... like she was on something,” said Cindy King, who was waiting for the train. “She started picking a fight with a passenger in line. Then the train came along and she just jumped.”
Major delay at MACR due to a medical emergency and police investigation. MACR stn has reopened but expect delays in area.
— SFBARTalert (@SFBARTalert) November 8, 2018 Just before 10 a.m. paramedics pulled the woman out of the station on a stretcher. Her eyes were open and she was moving slightly, but the extent of her injuries couldn’t be determined.
Paramedics rescued the woman from the tracks and carried her, still conscious, out on a stretcher.
BART spokeswoman Anna Duckworth said the train did not hit the woman.
“The person is being taken to a hospital for a psychiatric evaluation,” Duckworth said.
