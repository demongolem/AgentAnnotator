Duck Donuts, a North Carolina doughnut chain known for its customizable, made-to-order doughnuts served warm, is planning its first Minnesota post in Woodbury come December.
The doughnut operation has continued to expand since it the first opened in 2007 in Kitty Hawk, N.C. There are more than 70 locations, with more planned.
Like the other locations, the Woodbury spot, on the northwest quadrant of Valley Creek Road and Bielenberg Drive, will allow you to choose from more than a dozen signature varieties, such as Bacon in the Sun, Peanut Butter Paradise, Blueberry Pancake, S’mores or Coconut Island Bliss.
Or, you can customize your vanilla cake doughnut with a variety of icings, such as chocolate, strawberry, peanut butter and cinnamon sugar, and then choose from toppings that include rainbow sprinkles, peanuts, bacon and Oreos. Finally, drizzle your doughnut with hot fudge, blackberry raspberry, salted caramel or marshmallow. Your doughnut is then made in front of you.
House coffee blends, breakfast sandwiches, doughnut sundaes will also be available.
