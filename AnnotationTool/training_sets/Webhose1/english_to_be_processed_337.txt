Posted by Ohio First Warn Weather on Sunday, October 28, 2018 This winter will be much different compared to the last several winters. This winter will be driven by a Modoki El Niño, which is different from a typical El Niño. Waters near the Equatorial Pacific are very warm, but only across the central portion — the waters off the coast of South America are colder. This could help fuel the subtropical jet and send many storms across the Gulf of Mexico and up the East Coast. If the cold air is present when the moisture meets, there could be some big snows.
The latest model predictions of ENSO show anything from a weak to moderate Niño forming this winter. The last time we had a moderate Niño was during the 2009-10 winter, which was a very cold and snowy winter for Virginia and the Mid-Atlantic region.
We think that there will be several shots of cold air this season, due to increasing snow cover across Eurasia (Europe and Asia,) and the help from a few recurving typhoons in the Western Pacific, which help to put a “buckle” in the jet stream and sends cold shots across the Eastern United States.
Another factor in our winter outlook that favors colder temperatures is the “warm blob” off the Alaskan coast. High pressure across the west will send the jet stream across Alaska, and then dip east of the Rockies, placing a trough across the East Coast. This means some very cold air at times. MONTHLY BREAKDOWN SUMMARY
Here’s what we “typically” see on average for snow during the winter:
