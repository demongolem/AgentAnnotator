Amidst Greater Morristown’s many entertainment offerings this weekend are several programs marking Veterans Day, to honor all who serve, and have served, our country.
The holiday began as Armistice Day, to commemorate the end of World War I, one century ago.
It was called “The War to End Wars,” or sometimes just, “The Great War.” 0-for-2.
Thank you to every serviceman and servicewoman for doing your part to keep America free.
