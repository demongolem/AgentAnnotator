References: mcdonalds.br & reuters Fast food giant McDonald's works in partnership with Fleetcor Technologies Inc on creating a new seamless payment option in Brazil. This will be implemented to the toll payment on the highway roads to increase the flow through Brazil's Sem Parar collection system. Sem Parar is Brazil's biggest "electronic toll road payment provider." These collectors systems are set between several highways, gas stations, parking lots, and more. To use the same system through the fast food chain's drive-thrus, consumers simply announce to the employees that they want to use their Sem Parar device. It is attached to the car and functions through a radio frequency to process the transaction and goes directly towards the consumer's monthly charge. This is set to launch in Brazil by the end of January in 100 McDonald's drive-thru locations.
