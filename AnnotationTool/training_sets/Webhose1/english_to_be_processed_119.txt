And he can run too. Photo by Wesley Hitt/Getty Images The debate for the NFL MVP award seems pretty clear to me. I readily admit I see the race through Black and Gold colored glasses. Drew Brees and Patrick Mahomes have each won the award three times this season. Yes Patrick Mahomes has more yards and TDs, but he also has three fumbles and seven interceptions with a 65.9 percent completion record. I give you Drew Brees who has one fumble and one interception and a completion percentage of 76.3. Oh, by the way, both have two rushing TDs. as well. From the Official Saints Site which also has video of Drew’s best week nine passes. New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees was named the FedEx Air Player of the Week for Week 9. The honor was announced Thursday, Nov. 8. Brees threw for 346 yards and four touchdowns in the Saints’ 45-35 victory over the previously undefeated Los Angeles Rams at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome last Sunday. It is the third time Brees has won the award this season. He also earned the honors in Weeks 3 and 5. Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes and Atlanta’s Matt Ryan were the other two quarterbacks up for the honor. FedEx will donate $2,000 to the USO in Brees’ name through FedEx Cares.
