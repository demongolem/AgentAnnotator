Why the Royal Fab 4 May Not Appear Together Anymore editor@purewow.com (PureWow) Reblog All good things must come to an end. Sadly, such is the case with the royal fab four. Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, Prince William and Kate Middleton will reportedly appear together in public less frequently once Markle gives birth. As 92-year-old Queen Elizabeth II prepares to retire from public duty, passing the throne to Prince Charles and making Prince William, 36, first in line to rule, the duties of the royal family are beginning to shift. With that, William and Harry, 34, are considering a formal separation of their joint royal household at Kensington Palace. This would form two courts with different missions unique to each brother. Now that both princes are married and have families of their own, it’s only natural that they should begin to forge their own paths. And since Harry is sixth in line to the throne, his duties are vastly different than William’s. As royal author Sally Bedell Smith explained to Vanity Fair , “I had heard that a division might be in the cards, and that it had a lot to do with Meghan—not in a negative way, but that Meghan and Harry’s interests were moving in different directions [from William and Kate’s]…The fab four was a nice construction, but they will only appear as a foursome from time to time.” With Harry and Markle’s , 37, first child set to arrive in spring, let’s hope we’re blessed with a couple more fab four outings before they begin to divide and conquer.
