You are probably used to using your headphones to stay entertained during a workout or a long commute. But did you know that headphones can provide a source of ambient sounds or light, soothing music to help you sleep at night ? Photo Credit: Kinga Cichewicz on Unsplash
This is especially helpful if you’ve been having trouble falling asleep or if racing thoughts are keeping you up. But the benefits of listening to music to enhance your quality of sleep don’t end there. Benefits of Sleeping With Headphones
According to the National Sleep Foundation, bedtime listening can help you wake up less during the night, and feel more rested in the morning.
Music has a relaxing effect and it releases feel-good chemicals in your brain. Soothing sounds can even help lower your heart and slow your breathing — a most welcome effect after stressful day. Headphones You Can Wear in Bed
When shopping for the perfect pair of headphones to wear at night, you want quality, of course, but long battery life and comfort are also important.
Other deciding factors include a good noise-cancelling function (extra noise could keep your brain alert), wired versus wireless (getting caught up in a wire while moving during the night is not ideal), and earbud versus cup or speaker styles (this mostly comes down to personal preference and the shape of your ear).
