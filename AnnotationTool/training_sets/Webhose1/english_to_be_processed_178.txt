WGAL News 8 45 PM EST Nov 8, 2018 Reporter HARRISBURG, Pa. —
An increasing numbers of cities, including some in the Susquehanna Valley, have adopted ordinances that lessen penalties for small amounts of marijuana.
While the action is often referred to as marijuana decriminalization, some members of law enforcement say that is far from the truth. Advertisement
"We didn't decriminalize marijuana," said Harrisburg police Capt. Gabe Olivera. "It's still a criminal offense."
Harrisburg was the first city in the Susquehanna Valley to pass legislation that allows officers to issue a summary offense rather than a misdemeanor in cases of marijuana possession in small amounts. A summary offense is equivalent to a speeding ticket.
"This was a savings for us, because an officer would normally take about an hour from the time they arrested the individual for the misdemeanor charge to the time they finished all the paperwork and submitted the complaint," Olivera said.
Getting caught with less than 30 grams of marijuana in Harrisburg won't always be knocked down to a summary offense, police said. So far this year, officers said they have issued 43 marijuana summary offenses, but 266 others have still been charged with a misdemeanor.
"You can see there that we are utilizing it, but we're not overusing it," Olivera said.
York passed a similar ordinance over the summer. The city's police department is in the middle of a six-month evaluation and wasn't ready for an interview.
Lancaster officials also decided in September to lessen the penalties for possessing small amounts of marijuana.
