Adriana Lima Just Announced She's Retiring from Victoria's Secret Erica Gonzales Photo credit: Dimitrios Kambouris - Getty Images More From Harper's BAZAAR Adriana Lima is saying goodbye to Victoria's Secret after two decades and 18 fashion shows with the brand. The Brazilian model and VS Angel, whose name has basically become synonymous with the lingerie label, shared the news on Instagram this evening, following the first taping of the Victoria's Secret's annual fashion show. Lima, 37, is in the model lineup, but it seems this will be her last time on the VS catwalk. She posted a video montage of her appearances in previous VS fashion shows. Her first ever was in 1999. Lima wrote a heartfelt note in the caption: "Dear Victoria, Thank you for showing me the world, sharing your secrets, and most importantly not just giving me wings but teaching me to fly. And all the ?? to the best fans in the ! Love, Adriana " Lima's exit follows that of Alessandra Ambrosio, another iconic Victoria's Secret Angel, who hung up her wings after last year's fashion show in Shanghai. Following last year's VSFS, Lima said that she wouldn't follow in her fellow model's footsteps right away, and that she wanted to hit her 20-show mark before saying goodbye to Victoria's Secret. "I plan to be at 20. Two more years. Maybe more, I don’t know," Lima told People last year. "It’s nature. I’m working out, I’m being healthy, so let’s see how the body is going to turn out. But I enjoy it. So let’s say 20." Whispers of her exit swirled earlier today after model Georgia Fowler, who is walking in this year's VS fashion show, let slip that this would be Lima's final runway. "It will be her last year I think," she told Grazia . ('You Might Also Like',)
