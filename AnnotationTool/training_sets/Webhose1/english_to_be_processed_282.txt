I mentioned Brantley being a potential target for the White Sox a few weeks ago.
Paul Hoynes, a beat reporter for the Indians, had this to say:
“Brantley has reportedly received offers from Atlanta, Philadelphia and the White Sox. The Indians did not offer Brantley a one-year $17.9 qualifying offer on Friday.”
If the White Sox do get their hands on Brantley, it could mean the end of Avi Garcia on the South Side. Brantley is coming off a year where he hit .309/.364/.468 with 17 home runs, 76 RBI, and a 3.5 WAR.
Brantley coming over to Chicago would not only help the White Sox, but hurt the Indians as well in just one move.
The 31 year old Brantley could play right field or be a DH for Chicago. They have many holes to fill even if they do snag Harper or Manny Machado. So significant yet under the radar moves like this one are just as important in filling out the rest of the team.
The details of the contract are unknown, but if Rick Hahn stays true to his word, this will be the first of many contracts offered to top free agents in hopes of turning the White Sox into a contender once again. 0 shares
