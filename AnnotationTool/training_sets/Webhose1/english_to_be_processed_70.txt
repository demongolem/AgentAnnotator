NRHA on All of Us Research Program Posted on Thursday November 08, 2018 Category: Deadline: November 27, 2018
The All of Us Research Program is a long-term initiative conducted by the National Institutes of Health that aims to enroll one million or more participants who will share information about their family health histories, lifestyles, and personal medical histories. The goal is to help improve researchers’ baseline understanding of what it means to be healthy and sick, ultimately to develop more precise and effective methods to keep people healthy and treat those who get sick. In this one-hour webinar, the National Rural Health Association (NRHA) will share information about the effort and provide context on how and why rural communities can participate.
