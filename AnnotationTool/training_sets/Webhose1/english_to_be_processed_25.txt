Bayshore Town Center has plan to attract more people Share 30 PM CST Nov 8, 2018 Anchor GLENDALE, Wis. —
Bayshore Town Center in Glendale is getting a $75 million makeover that will include a hotel, a senior living facility, more office space and more residential options.
"A lot of stores that people like are closing all across the country. It’s just the nature of retail in this current environment,” Glendale Mayor Bryan Kennedy said. Advertisement
The town center has struggled in recent years with losses that include the Boston Store, Sports Authority and its movie theater.
"It right-sizes the existing retail, so there will be less stores, but there will be much higher foot traffic, more restaurants more opportunity for people get out in the community to do things,” Kennedy said.
The owners of the mall want the city to help fund the plan, but Kennedy said it’s a win-win for everyone.
"This will pay off the existing TIFF bonds, so we will have over $60 million in current debt that will be satisfied. And going forward, there will be an agreement that will bring in more tax money for the city of Glendale,” Kennedy said.
City planners said they expect to have shovels in the ground on these plans by next summer.
