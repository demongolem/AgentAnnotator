Never ones to shy away from a hot pop culture moment, the writers of South Park made Red Dead Redemption 2 the barrel end of the joke on this week's episode , titled, "Time to Get Cereal."
The episode is notable not just for Red Dead 2's inclusion, but also the return of Al Gore (who's become a bowler in the South Park universe since losing the 2000 presidential election) and ManBearPig, the exactly-what-it-sounds-like demon that Gore warned South Park about back in Season 10.

Still, it was the Red Dead Redemption 2 subplot that will likely give gamers the biggest laughs, as Trey Parker, Matt Stone, and the South Park writing team managed to not only make numerous references to Arthur Morgan's Old West adventure, but they did so in such an accurate way as to make the jokes even funnier. To wit: South Park Police Detective Harrison Yates gets angry when his wife, Maggie, plays on his save game while he's been at work, and she notes that he couldn't possibly want to do "the snow level" again Yates also talks about camp upgrades his wife made that he didn't want, and the early-game brawl at the Valentine saloon One of the other police offers references hunting with Dutch Yates talks about his house in Valentine being built and acquiring a sniper rifle Al Gore talks about his RDR2 gang being wanted in Blackwater Yates mentions having a train to rob in Valentine The Detective mentions getting deputized and getting Honor points Yates references Horseshoe Overlook, where the Van der Linde Gang first sets up camp after coming down off of the Grizzlies Citadel Rock and Scarlett Meadows are two more actual places in Red Dead 2 referenced by Yates Satan references getting ambushed by rival gangs on the roads They do get one thing wrong: Al Gore mentions wanting to play RDR2 on his triple-monitor PC setup. Red Dead Redemption 2, of course, has not been announced for PC
The South Park team is clearly among the customers of the 17 million copies of Red Dead Redemption 2 that have shipped so far.
