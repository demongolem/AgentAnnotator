More like fantastic coats and where to find them.
On Thursday night, Ezra Miller proved he’s totally figured out cold-weather dressing, wearing an enormous black caped puffer coat on the red carpet for the world premiere of “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes Of Grindelwald” in Paris, France.
But the 26-year-old actor didn’t just wrap himself in a giant comforter — it’s actually couture.
Miller chose a floor-length, down-stuffed dress, hooded cape and gloves from Moncler’s fall 2018 collaboration with Pierpaolo Piccioli, the creative director of Valentino.
As if his dramatically-padded ensemble wasn’t enough of a style statement, the “Justice League” star added a swipe of deep burgundy lipstick for good measure.
Given that back in October 2017 Miller was the first man to rock Fenty Beauty lipstick on the red carpet, it seems likely that his latest shade is from the same makeup brand.
Rihanna would be proud.
