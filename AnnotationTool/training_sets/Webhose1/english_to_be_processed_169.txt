At this point of his decorated career, David Kinch doesn’t plan on opening any more fine dining restaurants.
His Michelin 3-star Manresa, which Kinch opened nearly two decades ago in Los Gatos and where he still spends a majority of his time, is an institution in the fine dining world. And while the chef enjoys being in the kitchen, crafting critically-acclaimed tasting menus priced at $275 per person, he has no intention of expanding his fine dining footprint.
The fact is evident in Kinch’s latest’s flurry of new projects, all of which have a more casual approach than Manresa.
“I’m getting to be an old man,” Kinch said with a laugh. “There’s no more fine dining in me.”
Next week on Nov. 14, Kinch is opening a new outpost of Manresa Bread. The 2,100-square-foot all-day cafe is headed to Campbell with a compact menu of baked goods, along with beer, wine and cocktails. Manresa’s star baker , Avery Ruzicka is running the operation.
Then there’s Mentone , Kinche’s forthcoming restaurant outside of Santa Cruz in Aptos Village, due to open in early 2019. Mentone is the Italian spelling for the French village of Menton on the border of France and Italy. While Kinch is still working on the details of the menu, people can expect pizza to be one of the options, thanks to flour milled by Ruzicka .
Meanwhile, Kinch’s New Orleans-inspired restaurant in Los Gatos, Bywater, remains a draw.
Though the last few months have been decidedly active for Kinch, the chef said the trend will not last forever.
“I just can’t keep growing,” he said. “I don’t want to work until I die.”
Kinch said his most recent projects are ones built on partnerships that will make it possible for him to eventually step out of the limelight and spend most of his time with Manresa. Chefs and bakers like Ruzicka, Kinch said, can take the reigns of any project and make it self-sufficient.
“I just know I can’t keep doing it forever,” he said.
