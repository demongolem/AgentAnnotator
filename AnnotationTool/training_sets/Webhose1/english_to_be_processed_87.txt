Sep 25, 2018 at 10:57am PDT Ice Cube comes for the president.
Just two days after the midterms, legendary rapper Ice Cube has released a new single, going after President Donald Trump .
The song, appropriately enough, is called “Arrest the President.”
The song is off of Cube’s upcoming album Everythang’s Corrupt , which is dropping on December 7th . On the track, Cube lets it be known how he feels about Trump, spitting lines like:
Arrest the president, you got the evidence That nigga is Russian intelligence When it rains it pours Did you know the new white was orange? Boy, you’re showing your horns They’re tryin’ to replace my halo with thorns You so basic with your vape stick Let’s go apeshit in the matrix

Ice Cube is one of the greatest political rappers of all time. So it’s great to see the legend get back to his roots. The track is available in select international markets, for now. If you’re in the U.S., you’ll be able to hear the full song at midnight. But you can hear a clip now: Look out for the video, which will drop on Friday, November 9th.
