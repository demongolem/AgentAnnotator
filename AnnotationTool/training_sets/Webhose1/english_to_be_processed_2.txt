Democrat Becca Rausch 'not surprised' she defeated incumbent Republican Ross Wednesday Nov 7, 2018 at 6:38 PM Nov 8, 2018 at 7:40 AM Democrat Becca Rausch said she was a better campaigner and had a superior staff. Those are the reasons she gave for her upset win over state Sen. Richard Ross.
NEEDHAM - Democrat Becca Rausch summed up her upset win over state Sen. Richard Ross, R-Wrentham, in the Norfolk, Bristol and Middlesex District with a simple declaration.
“We ran a fantastic race,” Rausch said. "I'm not surprised (I won)."
The 37,323-35,641 result was announced by the Rausch campaign early Wednesday, and Rausch said a major factor was her grassroots campaign.
“I knocked on a lot of doors in every town,” Rausch said.
She swept the northern portion of the district, in many cases by wide margins. Ross took every southern community, but Rausch got enough votes to help propel her to victory.
Victories for Rausch, according to The Associated Press, included Natick, 4,542-2,345; Needham, 5,092-2,564; Wayland, 4,732-2,381; and, Wellesley, 2,538-1,248. AP results for Ross included: Franklin, 4,870-4,006; Millis, 2,131-1,972; Norfolk, 3,096-1,958; North Attleborough, 6,434-5,048; Plainville, 2,496-1,507; and Wrentham 3,794-1,627.
Rausch won Sherborn, 1,354-913, and Ross took Attleboro, 3,387-3,055. Those results were provided by the Rausch campaign.
On Wednesday morning, Ross said he’s “still surprised” he lost, and acknowledged a campaign mistake of “not taking Becca seriously.” Ross has served the district since 2010 when he won a special election, replacing Scott Brown, a Republican who defeated former state Attorney General Martha Coakley to finish out the term of the late U.S. Sen. Ted Kennedy, a Democrat.
Rausch had a sizeable advantage in her campaign war chest for the general election - $64,437 to $22,711, according to the Massachusetts Office of Campaign and Political Finance. She also had a robust staff: a full-time campaign manager and field coordinator; and a part-time consultant, communications director, treasurer and events coordinator.
“I out-campaigned (Ross), that’s for sure,” Rausch said, “and, I think I did out-organize him.”
Ross spent election night at Morin’s Hometown Bar and Grill in Attleboro waiting for returns. Before they started coming in, he said his business and civic connections in the southern part of the district were an advantage over Rausch. Ross owns a funeral home in Wrentham founded by his father.
Ross mentioned three towns in the King Philip Regional School District – Wrentham, Plainville, Norfolk – as an example of interconnected communities that are solidly in his camp. He referred to the northern towns in the district as “islands” that don’t have comparable voting-block power.
Ross seemed to accept defeat Wednesday when he said, “There’s sun in the window, I had a good night’s sleep, and it doesn’t get any better than this.”
One of his daughters called to ask how he could have lost, and Ross said he told her, “’Don’t worry about it. There are plenty of things to do.’”
For Rausch, public education and transportation funding, health care, and the opioid epidemic were central the themes of her campaign. She said Wednesday she will focus on those issues after she is sworn into office on Jan. 2.
“Voters are hungry for change, engagement and leadership,” she said.
