Chelsea news: ‘I’m so happy we signed him’ - Joe Cole raves about star
“There were conditions to play badly – the cold, the opponents, the pitch, everything. But we could have done better.
“The first objective was to qualify. The second is to win the group. We need one more point for that.
“But it’s important because now we don’t talk again about this competition until February.

He added: "Today I was in trouble, too. I had fever. It was a very hard day for me. I don't know if I am improving or if it is only the temperature."
BATE, comfortably beaten last month in London, struck the woodwork three times, including deep in stoppage time, and Eden Hazard's services were required for longer than anticipated in Belarus.
As the game clicked into the 51st minute, Hazard was fouled and sent the resulting free-kick soaring out of play beyond the far post.
Hazard had been due to be off by then and Sarri was gesticulating wildly in his technical area, apparently towards the Belgian.
Giroud struck moments later, heading in Emerson Palmieri's cross at the near post.
Giroud told BT Sport: "It's true, I was hoping to score soon because I came back late from the World Cup and lacked a bit of luck. You always have to work hard and keep the faith."
Sarri added: "I'm pleased for him. He's a very important player for us, because he's a very, very useful player for the team. Related articles
