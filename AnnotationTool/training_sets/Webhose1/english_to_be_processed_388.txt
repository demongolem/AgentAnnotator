Vancouver police has issued a public warning that a convicted child abductor is now living in Vancouver, and poses a risk to the safety of young boys.
Randall Hopley, 53, was convicted of abducting three-year-old Sparwood toddler Kienan Hebert from his home in 2011. Hopley was sentenced to six years behind bars in 2013, and has since been released.
He was also previously convicted of sexual assault and break-and-enters, police said in a news release Thursday.
The Correctional Service of Canada has assessed Hopley as “a high risk for violent and sexual re-offending,” police said. He is bound by a 10-year long-term supervision order.
Police said he is living in Vancouver under several conditions, including to not be in, near or around places where children under the age of 16 are likely to be, unless accompanies by an adult approved by his parole supervisor.
He also must abide by a daily curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Hopley is described as white, five foot nine inches tall, 150 lbs., with brown hair, hazel eyes and often has a beard.
Anyone who sees Hopley violating conditions is asked to call 911.
