0 comment ONE of the most popular ladies fundraising events of the year is only four days away.
Troon Ladies Circle are holding their Black & Bling Ball at the Carlton Hotel, Prestwick this coming Saturday, at 7pm.
The fabulous fundraising event is supporting 'The Small but Mighty' to support The Brain Tumour Charity.
The glamorous evening includes a delightful meal and groovy entertainment with local band legends, 'Memphis'.
As always, we will also have our outstanding raffle supported by the many generous businesses and people from the local community.
All proceeds from the ball will be presented to the 'The Small but Mighty'.
For more details, see the Troon Ladies Circle Facebook page.
